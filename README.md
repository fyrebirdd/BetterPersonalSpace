<h1>Better Personal Space</h1>

Adds a custom personal space function to the game, allowing the user to select what players are hidden by personal space.

This mod requires [ReMod.Core](https://github.com/RequiDev/ReMod.Core) for its Ui.(Download it and put it in the VRChat folder, not the mods folder)

I recommend getting [TabExtension](https://github.com/DragonPlayerX/TabExtension) to help with Quickmenu tab overcrowding. 

<h2>Settings</h2>
Note: I have not tested this with the regular personal space on, please turn it off if you plan to use this.

<h3>Bps Enabled:</h3>
Enables the filtering of Players.

<h3>Hide Friends:</h3>
Allows HideAllByDefault and AffectHiddenAvatars to hide friends as well (toggling friends off will always hide them).

<h3>Personal Space:</h3>
The size of your personal bubble in meters (Default 1 meter).

<h3>Hide All By Default:</h3>
Hides all players by default (Enabling Hide Friends will also hide friends by default).

<h3>Affect Hidden Avatars:</h3>
Hiding someones avatar will make them also affected by personal space filtering (Will only affect friends if Hide Friends is enabled).

<h2>Per-Player settings</h2>
<h3>Show Player</h3>
Will not filter this player

<h3>Hide Player</h3>
Will always filter this player
